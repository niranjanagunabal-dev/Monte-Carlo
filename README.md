# Monte-Carlo
This project estimates the elastic modulus of a beam by accounting for uncertainties in load, length, deflection, and cross sectional dimensions. Monte Carlo Simulation with 200,000 samples is used to propagate uncertainties and analyze variability, with results compared against LLM based generative AI solutions.
